# Cat App

## Overview

This a simple React app that serves as a practical exercise to delve into the fundamentals of React component development and styling with Tailwind CSS.   

## Setup

- In your system terminal make sure you are in the directory that you want your Next app to go. To see where you are you can run:

        pwd

- If you need to navigate somewhere else, to see the files in your current directory, you can run:

        ls

- You can move into the correct directory by running:

        cd <desired directory>

- Create a New Next.js Application
    * Run - NOTE: if we run w/out a project name, the terminal will ask us to enter a project name. 

            npx create-next-app@latest
    
- You will then be asked a series of questions...

- Navigate to your new project by running:

        cd cat-app

- Then you can open a VScode window by running: 

        code .

- To install dependencies run:

        npm install

- To open the deployment server run:

        npm run dev

- Create a new repository on Github. NOTE: don't select add README or .gitignore
    * Quick set up will pop up...Run the code that says Add repo to existing repo on the command-line. 

- Add your Next app to your new repository by running this in bash terminal:

        git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
